t0C_1,t0,choice,0,0,"Today is a good day for cross-training. Enjoy yourself. If you ride, keep it mellow and fun.",0
t0E_1,t0,easy,0,0,"You expended some energy yesterday. You should do an easy workout today to ensure good recovery. You may want to consider cross-training. If you ride, keep it in zone 1-2.",0
t1H_1,t1,hard,0,0,"If you have time, you should do a long endurance workout today.  Endurance means most of your time should be spent in power zone 2.  If limited time, ride easy tempo - low zone 3.  This is the time of the season to build your endurance engine.  Cross-training is still an option at this point in the season but keep the focus on endurance.  If power data is not available for your selected activity you will need to estimate your training load.",0
t1M_1,t1,moderate,0,0,"You should do a moderate endurance (power zone 2) workout today.  If time is limited, ride easy tempo - low zone 3.  Cross-training is still on the table. Just remember to estimate your training load for the day if power data is not available.",0
t2MT3_1,t2,moderate,3,0,Today you should do rolling hills at a moderate pace. Climb steadily at a high cadence and try to keep power in Zone 3 - 4 when climbing. It is easy for effort to rise higher than intended when climbing. If hills are not an option in your area a brisk headwind will suffice. Monitor Training Load during your ride to make sure you stay under your upper load target.,0
t2M_1,t2,moderate,0,0,A tempo ride of moderate duration would be a good choice for today. Tempo means a good portion of your ride should be in power zone 3. Keep tabs on Training Load during your ride to ensure you do sufficient work without overdoing it.,0
t2H_1,t2,hard,0,0,"A long endurance ride is called for today. Most of your time should be spent in power zone 2. Intensity will be low but if you hit your target Training Load you will be fatigued after this ride. If time is limited, this can be more of a tempo-to-sweet spot ride - zone 3 to low zone 4. If riding in hilly terrain effort will naturally rise above zones 2/3 on the climbs but strive to keep the effort moderate. During your ride, on climbs and on the flats, you should periodically increase your cadence beyond your normal comfort range. Learning to spin a higher cadence will make you a more efficient cyclist.",0
t3HT5_1,t3,hard,5,0,"Today you should do a long climbing ride at a moderate pace. Do longer climbs if they are available. Maximum power may rise into Zone 5 but do not stay there for long, you do not want to overdo it.  Keep an eye on your Training Load to make sure you do not overdo it.",0
t3HT3_1,t3,hard,3,0,Today you should do a long ride with some shorter climbs at a moderate pace.  Keep cadence high and power in Zone 4/low zone 5 when climbing.  Monitor your Training Load to make sure you stay within your daily Load targets.,0
t3M_1,t3,moderate,0,0,"Today you should do an endurance ride of moderate duration.  Remember, endurance means spending most of your time in zone 2. When climbing your effort will rise beyond zone 2  but stay out of zone 5. On the descents you should let effort fall into zone 1.  Ride in the sweet-spot - high zone 3 to low zone 4 - if time is limited. Whenever you think about it, increase your cadence a bit.",0
t3H_1,t3,hard,0,0,"Today you should do a long tempo ride.  Tempo means you should spend much of your ride in power zone 3. Early in your ride zone 3 will feel easy  but resist the temptation to go harder. Sustaining a tempo pace for an extended time is challenging.  If training time is limited, make this a sweet-spot ride, meaning high zone 3 to low zone 4.  If your route includes hills keep effort in Zone 4 or below while climbing.  As always, keep cadence high.",0
t4MT3_1,t4,moderate,3,0,Write this workout.,0
t4HT3_1,t4,hard,3,0,Today you should seek out hills similar to your goal event.  Climb strongly but do not over do it. You want to be able to put in a hard but sustainable effort on every climb. Use your Training Load targets to determine ride duration.,0
t4H_1,t4,hard,0,0,"Today you should work on fast intensity. Your focus should be on maintaing a Zone 5 effort for several minutes at a time. A fast group ride can be an excellent way to do this workout. If you are feeling strong, go to the front and take a hard pull several times during the course of this ride. Just be careful that you keep enough in reserve to stay with the group after your pull.",0
t4M_1,t4,moderate,0,0,Your workout today should focus on riding a hard pace for an extended duration. Look for opportunities to ride 5 to 10 minutes in Zone 4 on flat or rolling terrain. These efforts require close attention to maintain a hard but sustainable pace.,0
t5HI5_1,t5,hard,0,5,"Today you should work on race-pace intensity. If riding in a group, look for opportunities to attack in situations similar to what you might expect in your goal event. If others are in an attacking mood, cover those attacks. If riding alone use your imagination to visualize race scenarios and ride as is you are racing them. The goal today is to simulate the intensity of your goal event.",0
t5MT3_1,t5,moderate,3,0,Today is a climbing day. Ride hills similar to the ones in your goal event. Focus on climbing strongly without going into the red. Monitor total Training Load during your ride to ensure you stay within your target load range.,0
t5H_1,t5,hard,0,0,"Your goal today is to do a longer ride while working on riding for an extended period at threshold power. Threshold is Zone 4. After a good warmup, if the legs feel good, ride for at least 15 minutes at this pace, longer if you feel capable.",0
t5M_1,t5,moderate,0,0,"You should do a shorter ride with one long interval riding at threshold power - Zone 4. Warmup for 10 - 20 minutes then ride for an extended period in zone 4, keeping an eye on your ride load to ensure you stay within your load targets.",0
t6HT1_1,t6,hard,1,0,"Your goal today is to do a climb that simulates the one you expect to be most significant in your goal event, the climb most likely to determine how well you do. Visualize racing the climb and hitting the top in the lead. The number of times you do the climb will be determined by the length and steepness of the climb but be careful not to do too much. Your Training Load targets will help you guage how much work to do. Your are peaking for your goal and are looking to put the right finishing touch on your fitness.",0
t6H_1,t6,hard,0,0,"You should work on threshold (Zone 4) power today. Warm up well, then ride for an extended period at this pace, using your Training Load targets to guide the duration of the effort. Since you are peaking for your goal event, intensity should be high but your load targets are smaller.",0
t6M_1,t6,moderate,0,0,Today a shorter durantion endurance (power zone 2) ride is in order. You are peaking for your goal event and it is important to maintain endurace.,0
rHT1_1,race,hard,1,0,Today you should ride a climb similar in pitch to the steepest climb in your goal event. Do not climb for more than a few minutes and limit the number of repeats to just a few. The goal today is to hone the climbing skills you have been training all season. Visualize the race climb. See yourself riding strongly and confidently!,0
rH_1,race,hard,0,0,"Today you should focus on riding at threshold - Zone 4 into lower Zone 5. Do a good warm-up, then ride for a moderate period at this pace, using your Training Load targets to keep the duration within bounds. Intensity will be high but do not jeopardize your race performance by doing too much work today. Today you want to put the finishing touch on your race fitness. Visualize the crunch segments of your goal event. See yourself riding strongly, head up and confident!",0
rM_1,race,moderate,0,0,"You should do a shorter ride with one moderate duration interval in Zone 4. Warmup well then start y our interval. Use your load targets to determine interval duration. At this point in your season, less is better than more.",0
