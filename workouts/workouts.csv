t2Endurance1,t2,hard,0,unstructured,"A long endurance ride is called for today. Most of your time should be spent in power zone 2. Intensity will be low but if you hit your target Training Load you will be fatigued after this ride. If time is limited, this can be more of a tempo-to-sweet spot ride - zone 3 to low zone 4. If riding in hilly terrain effort will naturally rise above zones 2/3 on the climbs but strive to keep the effort moderate. During your ride, on climbs and on the flats, you should periodically increase your cadence beyond your normal comfort range. Learning to spin a higher cadence will make you a more efficient cyclist."
t2ModerateHills1,t2,moderate,3,unstructured,Today you should do rolling hills at a moderate pace. Climb steadily at a high cadence and try to keep power in Zone 3 - 4 when climbing. It is easy for effort to rise higher than intended when climbing. If hills are not an option in your area a brisk headwind will suffice. Monitor Training Load during your ride to make sure you stay under your upper load target.
t2Tempo1,t2,moderate,0,unstructured,A tempo ride of moderate duration would be a good choice for today. Tempo means a good portion of your ride should be in power zone 3. Keep tabs on Training Load during your ride to ensure you do sufficient work without overdoing it.
t1Hard1,t1,hard,0,unstructured,"If you have time, you should do a long endurance workout today.  Endurance means most of your time should be spent in power zone 2.  If limited time, ride easy tempo - low zone 3.  This is the time of the season to build your endurance engine.  Cross-training is still an option at this point in the season but keep the focus on endurance.  If power data is not available for your selected activity you will need to estimate your training load."
t1Moderate1,t1,moderate,0,unstructured,"You should do a moderate endurance (power zone 2) workout today.  If time is limited, ride easy tempo - low zone 3.  Cross-training is still on the table. Just remember to estimate your training load for the day if power data is not available."
t0Easy1,t0,easy,0,unstructured,"You expended some energy yesterday. You should do an easy workout today to ensure good recovery. You may want to consider cross-training. If you ride, keep it in zone 1-2."
t0Choice1,t0,choice,0,unstructured,"Today is a good day for cross-training. Enjoy yourself. If you ride, keep it mellow and fun."
